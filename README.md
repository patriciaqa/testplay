# Automated Testing with Playwright and JavaScript

This project aims to demonstrate automated testing using Playwright and JavaScript. Playwright is a Node.js library for automating browsers, enabling us to write end-to-end tests to ensure the functionality and integrity of web applications.

## Setup

1. **Install Node.js**: If you haven't already, [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/patriciaqa/testplay.git
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:
    ```
    cd your-project
    npm install
    ```

## Running Tests

To run the automated tests, execute the following command in your terminal:

```
npx playwright test
```

This command will execute the tests defined in the `tests` directory using Playwright.
